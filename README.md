1. Create a new Flask project called counter

2. Have the root route render a template that displays the number of times the client has visited this site. Refresh the page several times to ensure the counter is working.

3. Add a "/destroy_session" route that clears the session and redirects to the root route. Test it.

4. NINJA BONUS: Add a +2 button underneath the counter and a new route that will increment the counter by 2

5. NINJA BONUS: Add a Reset button to reset the counter

6. SENSEI BONUS: Add a form that allows the user to specify the increment of the counter and have the counter increment accordingly

7. SENSEI BONUS: Adjust your code to display both how many times the user has actually visited the page, as well as the value of the counter, given the above functionality
